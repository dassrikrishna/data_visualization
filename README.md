## 1. Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the closing prices and log returns for SBIN.NS and INFY.NS. The core objective is to **model and forecast both stock prices and their associated volatilities** using various time series techniques. The models employed include:
*   **ARIMA** (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) for price forecasting.
*   **GARCH** (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) and **GJR-GARCH** for volatility modeling, accounting for volatility clustering and asymmetric responses to shocks.
*   **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**, specifically the Peaks Over Threshold (POT) method with a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) fit, to model extreme market events.

The analysis is implemented using a suite of Python libraries for data handling, statistical modeling, and visualization.

## 2. Data Acquisition and Initial Exploration

*   **Data Slices**: Closing price data for SBIN.NS and INFY.NS.
*   **Decisions**:
    *   Historical closing prices were **downloaded from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)** for the maximum available period.
    *   Initial closing price data samples were displayed.
    *   Visualizations of historical closing prices were generated to observe **long-term trends and fluctuations**.
    *   **Classical decomposition** (additive model, 252-period seasonality) was applied to the closing prices.
*   **Conclusion**: Initial exploration provided a foundational understanding of the stock price movements.

## 3. Stationarity Tests on Close Prices

*   **Data Slices**: Closing price series for SBIN.NS and INFY.NS.
*   **Decisions**:
    *   **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests** were performed to check for stationarity.
    *   **Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests** were also performed for robust stationarity assessment.
*   **Conclusion**: Both the ADF and KPSS tests consistently indicated that the close price series for both SBIN.NS and INFY.NS are **not stationary**.

## 4. ARIMA Model Forecasting

*   **Data Slices**: First difference of the close prices for SBIN.NS and INFY.NS, split into training (95%) and testing (5%) sets.
*   **Decisions**:
    *   ACF and PACF plots were generated for the first differenced series to aid in **ARIMA order identification**.
    *   The `ndiffs` function, utilizing the ADF test, indicated that **one difference was required** for both series to achieve stationarity.
    *   The `auto_arima` function was used to automatically select the best ARIMA(p,d,q) model order by **minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**.
    *   Model performance on the test set was evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.
*   **Conclusion**:
    *   **SBIN.NS**: Best model was **ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,0,0) with an intercept** (AIC: 40372.382). Performance metrics: **RMSE: 53.8107**, **MAPE: 5.70%**.
    *   **INFY.NS**: Best model was **ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,0,0) with an intercept** (AIC: 51137.707). Performance metrics: **RMSE: 193.9741**, **MAPE: 9.90%**.

## 5. Log Returns Analysis and Volatility Modeling

*   **Data Slices**: Daily log returns for both SBIN.NS and INFY.NS.
*   **Decisions**:
    *   Log returns were computed as a percentage.
    *   Stationarity of log returns was tested using the **ADF test**.
    *   The presence of **ARCH effects** was checked using the ARCH test to identify volatility clustering.
    *   Log return data was split into training (95%) and testing (5%) sets.
*   **Conclusion**:
    *   Log return series for both stocks were found to be **stationary** (SBI-Returns p-value: 0.0, INFY-Returns p-value: 3.11e-26).
    *   Significant **ARCH effects were present** in both log returns (ARCH Test p-value: 0.0000 for both), confirming volatility clustering.

## 6. GARCH Model for Log Returns

*   **Data Slices**: Training and testing sets of log returns for SBIN.NS and INFY.NS.
*   **Decisions**:
    *   A custom function (`best_garch_model`) was used to find the **best GARCH(p,q) model with a Studentâ€™s t-distribution** by minimizing AIC.
    *   Model performance was evaluated using **RMSE** on rolling forecasts.
*   **Conclusion**:
    *   **SBIN.NS**: Best GARCH model was **GARCH(1,2)** with an AIC of 30773.3989. **RMSE for forecast: 0.4651**.
    *   **INFY.NS**: Best GARCH model was **GARCH(1,5)** with an AIC of 29477.6792. **RMSE for forecast: 0.3951**.

## 7. GJR-GARCH Model with Students-T Distribution

*   **Data Slices**: Log returns of SBIN.NS and INFY.NS.
*   **Decisions**:
    *   A **GJR-GARCH(1,1,1) model with a Students-T distribution** was applied to capture asymmetric volatility responses to positive and negative shocks.
    *   AIC and BIC were considered for model selection.
    *   Ljung-Box tests on residuals and squared residuals, and the ARCH LM test, were used to diagnose model fit and ensure no remaining ARCH effects.
*   **Conclusion**:
    *   **SBIN.NS**: AIC: 30772.4217, BIC: 30813.6153. **RMSE for forecast: 0.4746**. The ARCH LM p-value was 0.8120734381292837, indicating **no remaining ARCH effects** in the standardized residuals.
    *   **INFY.NS**: AIC: 29508.6811, BIC: 29549.8746. **RMSE for forecast: 0.4364**. The ARCH LM p-value was 0.8951512570675989, also indicating **no remaining ARCH effects** in the standardized residuals.

## 8. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) - Peaks Over Threshold (POT) and GPD Fit

*   **Data Slices**: Log returns for SBIN.NS and INFY.NS.
*   **Decisions**:
    *   **Peaks Over Threshold (POT) method** was used with a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).
    *   Initial exploration involved **Block Maxima and POT methods**, **Mean Residual Life plots**, and **Parameter Stability plots** for threshold selection.
    *   Specific **upper and lower thresholds** were set for each stock based on these analyses.
    *   GPD parameters were fitted to exceedances, and **return period summaries** were generated.
    *   **Goodness-of-Fit tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling)** were performed to assess the GPD fit.
    *   A **smooth CDF** was constructed using a t-distribution for the body and GPD tails with a logistic splice for transition.
*   **Conclusion**:
    *   **SBIN.NS**: Upper threshold: 6.8 (73 exceedances), Lower threshold: -7.1 (45 exceedances). Fitted GPD upper tail parameters: shape=0.2347, scale=1.2698. Fitted GPD lower tail parameters: shape=0.0930, scale=1.9219. KS test for uniformity of PIT values yielded a p-value of **0.0220**.
    *   **INFY.NS**: Upper threshold: 5 (210 exceedances), Lower threshold: -7.8 (60 exceedances). Fitted GPD upper tail parameters: shape=-0.0869, scale=2.2910. Fitted GPD lower tail parameters: shape=0.3693, scale=1.6635. KS test for uniformity of PIT values yielded a p-value of **0.0600**.
